Sample sphere rotation using the mixedstep gameloop code. The physics is tied to fps in this gameloop, better implemenation is to run gamelogic in delta time interval. 
Notes:  
1. Right Click to select target framerate (default 30)  
2. In order for the no-cap version to work disable vsync or similar settings in the nvidia control panel or driver software.  
3. No-cap option simply increases the fps, not the physics.  
4. Use Fraps on windows or glxosd on linux to measure framerate.
